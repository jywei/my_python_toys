# An IDENTITY matrix is a square matrix in which all the elements
# on the principal/main diagonal are 1 and all the elements outside
# the principal diagonal are 0.
# (A square matrix is a matrix in which the number of rows
# is equal to the number of columns)

def is_identity_matrix(grid):
    #Write your code here
    gridSize = len(grid)     # Extract size of grid  (defined by number of rows)
    numCols = len(grid[0])  # Extract number of columns
    if gridSize != numCols:  # If grid is non-square
        return False

    i = 0
    while i < gridSize:
        j = 0
        while j < gridSize:   # for each entry in ith row/column
            # work through the ith row
            if i == j and grid[i][j] != 1:
                return False
            elif i != j and grid[i][j] != 0:
                return False
            j +=1
        i += 1   # next row/column
    return True
